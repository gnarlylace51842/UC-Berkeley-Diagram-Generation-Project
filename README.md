# UC-Berkeley-Diagram-Generation-Project
During the Summer of my 9th grade year, I teamed up with some PhD students at UC Berkeley to help generate them Diagrams for their project regarding Neurocomputing. I did this using my knowledge of Pygame at the time.
There were 4 diagrams that I had to generate over the span of 4 weeks, each displaying nodes that would be shown via Pygame. They each were:
1. 4 Groups of Nodes scattered
2. 4 Groups of Nodes scattered in 4 specific Quadrants
3. Nodes being ran all at once
4. Nodes being ran one at a time.

By using a .npz file I was given, I would translate that data into Pygame data to be used in the diagram. 

To use this program:
1. First, move all of the assets given into the main folder of your IDE.
2. Then, run the file you want via Terminal
3. In an external window of Pygame, the diagram will be shown.
